This is ATestML, a simple implementation in perl6 of kind of TestML, which you 
can find at http://www.testml.org.

with credits to creators of TestML from http://www.testml.org

Pretty much of concept and syntax are taken from that project, but in a much 
simpler way.

There were some issues, why I re-implemented it and also simplified it:

* I needed a simple test markup language for testing parsers
* I did not like to always create two files for a testsuite (each .tml file
  needs a .t file for running)
* the perl6 implementation of TestML was broken, or not complete
* extending the bridges was not easy enough, because you need knowledge about
  concept of test-contexts and such stuff
